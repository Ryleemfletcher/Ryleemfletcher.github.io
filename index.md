I am a computer science major at Cal State Fullerton University. My goal is to graduate in 2028 with a computer science degree and some other minor degrees. 

## Favorite labs from CPSC 120L

Lab 3, part 2, was my favorite lab. During this lab programming started to click for me. I realized the importance of stepping away from the computer and solving the problem on paper without all the code. Because I stepped away, I was able to come up with a solution to how the program would work, and it did! It was a great moment for me!

Lab 6, part 2, has become one of my favorite labs because of the challenge. My partner and I were tasked to develop a program with functions that held cards in a deck so the user could play Blackjack. Our program was spot on, except for the ace bonus. My partner and I tried various complicated statements and expressions to get the ace bonus right, but it was a simple statement. I learned a valuable lesson: try to keep things simple because the answer is usually simple.

In Lab 8, Part 1, I learned the importance of listening to myself. My partner's and my program were correct except for one return statement that I suggested we should remove, and so did my partner later on, but it made sense to keep it earlier in the lab. But the return statement ended up being why our program failed to work, and we realized that in the end. It was a great learning experience.
